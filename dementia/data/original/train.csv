269-0-a,1,269,17,1~2,well I'm seeing alot of water that isn't supposed to be where it is. a full sink with uh more water running down all all all the way to the floor 
269-0-b,1,269,17,3,a stool that's going to project somebody into a fall and real fast
269-0-c,1,269,17,4~6,getting out of the cookie jar. dishwashing and drying. and a girl trying to say silent so that uh they won't be caught
269-0-d,1,269,17,7,two cups and a plate uh that probably are dry and then the other plate is being dried.

269-1-e,1,269,13,6~8,to uh uh up up on that stool and she's making fun of him. and this water's coming down that splashing all over the place. 
269-1-f,1,269,13,9,it depends on how many cookies are in that cookie jar apparently 
270-2-a,1,270,20,1~2,it looks like a woman. I assume she's drying a dish. there's a window open in the kitchen
270-2-b,1,270,20,3~5,there is a child reaching for a cookie from the cookie jar. the uh ladder that he's standing on is beginning to fall
